          <img class="right" src="images/snow2.jpg" alt="snowboarder flying upside down!">
          <p>Modern snowboarding began in 1965 when Sherman Poppen, an engineer
            in Muskegon, Michigan, invented a toy for his daughters by fastening
            two skis together and attaching a rope to one end so he would have
            some control as they stood on the board and glided downhill. Dubbed
            the "snurfer" (combining snow and surfer) by his wife Nancy, the toy
            proved so popular among his daughters' friends that Poppen licensed
            the idea to a manufacturer, Brunswick Corporation, that sold about a
            million snurfers over the next decade. And, in 1966 alone over half
            a million snurfers were sold.</p>

          <h3 class="indent-text">STYLES:</h3>
          <p>Since snowboarding's inception as an established winter sport, it
            has developed various styles, each with its own specialized
            equipment and technique. The most common styles today are: freeride,
            freestyle, and freecarve/race. These styles are used for both
            recreational and professional snowboarding. While each style is
            unique, there is overlap between them.</p>
