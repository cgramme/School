          <img class="right" src="images/surf.jpg" alt="snowboarder flying upside down!">
          <p>For hundreds of years, surfing was a central part of ancient
            Polynesian culture. Surfing may have first been observed by British
            explorers at Tahiti in 1767. Samuel Wallis and the crew members of
            the Dolphin who were the first Britons to visit the island in June
            of that year. Another candidate is the botanist Joseph Banks[2]
            being part of the first voyage of James Cook on the HMS Endeavour,
            who arrived on Tahiti on 10 April 1769. Lieutenant James King was
            the first person to write about the art of surfing on Hawaii when he
            was completing the journals of Captain James Cook upon Cook's death
            in 1779.</p>

          <h3 class="indent-text">CULTURE:</h3>
          <p>Surfers represent a diverse culture based on riding the waves. Some
            people practice surfing as a recreational activity while others make
            it the central focus of their lives. Surfing culture is most
            dominant in Hawaii and California because these two states offer the
            best surfing conditions. However, waves can be found wherever there
            is coastline, and a tight-knit yet far-reaching subculture of
            surfers has emerged throughout America. Some historical markers of
            the culture included the woodie, the station wagon used to carry
            surfers' boards, as well as boardshorts, the long swim shorts
            typically worn while surfing. Surfers also wear wetsuits in colder
            regions.</p>
