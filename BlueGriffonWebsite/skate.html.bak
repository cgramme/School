          <img class="right" src="images/skate4.jpg" alt="snowboarder flying upside down!">
          <p>Skateboarding, as we know it, was probably born sometime in the
            late 1940s, or early 1950s,[citation needed] when surfers in
            California wanted something to do when the waves were flat. This was
            called "sidewalk surfing" - a new wave of surfing on the sidewalk as
            the sport of surfing became highly popular. No one knows who made
            the first board; it seems that several people came up with similar
            ideas at around the same time. The first manufactured skateboards
            were ordered by a Los Angeles, California surf shop, meant to be
            used by surfers in their downtime.</p>
          <br>
          <h3 class="indent-text">CULTURE:</h3>
          <p>Skateboarding was, at first, tied to the culture of surfing. As
            skateboarding spread across the United States to places unfamiliar
            with surfing or surfing culture, it developed an image of its own.
            For example, the classic film short Video Days (1991) portrayed
            skateboarders as reckless rebels.</p>
