          <h3 id="reservations">Reservations</h3>
          <p>            Our Reservations Department is staffed with five Certified Travel Agents, 
            each of whom is eager to assist you in making your travel plans. They have specialty 
            areas in Africa, the Caribbean, South America, Western Europe, Eastern Europe, 
            Asia, Antarctica, and Hawaii and the South Pacific. They also specialize in 
            Senior Travel, Family Travel, Student Travel, and Special Needs Travel. Call 
            us at <i>(555) 848-0807</i> extension 75 or e-mail us at <i><a href="mailto:mailbox@tripsmart.com">Reservations</a></i> to begin making your travel plans now. We will be happy to send you brochures 
            and listings of Internet addresses to help you get started. We are open from 
            8:00 a.m. until 6:00 p.m. CST.</p>
          <h3 id="outfitters">Travel 
            Outfitters</h3>
          <p>            Our travel outfitters are seasoned travelers that have accumulated a vast amount 
            of knowledge in appropriate travel clothing and accessories for specific destinations. 
            Climate and seasons, of course, are important factors in planning your wardrobe 
            for a trip. Area customs should also be taken in consideration so as not to 
            offend the local residents with inappropriate dress. When traveling abroad, 
            we always hope that our customers will represent our country well as good ambassadors. 
            If they can be comfortable and stylish at the same time, we have succeeded! 
            Our clothing is all affordable and packs well on long trips. Most can be washed 
            easily in a hotel sink and hung to drip-dry overnight. Browse through our <a href="catalog.html">on-line 
            catalog</a>, then give us a call at <i>(555) 433-7844</i> extension 85. We will 
            also be happy to mail you a catalog of our extensive collection of travel clothing 
            and accessories.</p>
